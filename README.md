# Python-turtle-Game
A simple UNFINISHED game in python turtle where a player can move around using the arrow keys and collect points wwhilst avoiding two enemies of different speeds. The speed of each enemy increases with every point making the game harder as you coninue.

PS: I am by far a good programmer and I am aware that their are a lot of bugs in my code however I believe it is somewhat a achievement and want to thank you for taking an interest.
